# Kaggle Challenge
### The Problem:
This challenge was a binary classification of patients as either having, or not having kidney stones based on the 6 features of a urinalysis. This data was actually generated from a deep learning model trained on the "Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis" dataset.
### The Discussion:
The data for this challence came in 2 files: a traing file and a testing file meant as the test set to be scored. The training file is only 414 different simulated patients. I started by segregating this set into a set with kidney stones(target = 1), and a set without kidney stones (target = 0). Using this differentiation, some visualization showed a slight correlation betweensome of the features, but nothing very promenent.
